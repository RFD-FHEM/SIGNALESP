# SIGNALDuino uC v3.2 (development version)

System to receive digital signals and provide them to other systems pro demodulatiob. Currently tested with 433 MHZ, but not limited to that frequency or media.

### Getting started


Just clone the repo and open the project file with code:blocks. (currently this works only for windows)
Compile it and have fun.
If you are using the Arduino IDE, you have to copy all the libs into your sketch folder.

### Using SIGNALDuino in FHEM

If you want to use the SIGNALDuino with FHEM, you can use it directly from FHEM. No neet to compile any sourcode.
You find more Information here:

### Tested microcontrollers

* Aduino Nano

### Signal from my device ist not detected

We have a pattern detection engine, that detect serval signal types. May not all, but most of them.

Uncomment #define debugdetect in libs/remotesensor/patterdecoder.h
Search for some output which describes a pattern with serval bits received.
If you find something, open an issue and provide as much as possible informations with it.
